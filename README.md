This repository hosts the
[Notifications API Standard](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `notifications.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments"
here (I know). Also, the Notifications API Standard uses
[bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to generate `notifications.html`. (Do not worry if
using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need to contain the generated HTML.)

### Merge policy

If you can commit to this repository, see
[whatwg/html TEAM](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/TEAM.md) for guidelines.

### Tests

Tests can be found in the `notifications/` directory of
[`w3c/web-platform-tests`](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
